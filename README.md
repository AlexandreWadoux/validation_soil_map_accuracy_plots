# Validation of soil maps based on accuracy plots
Sample codes for the accuracy plots and uncertainty quantification measures developed in the paper of Deutsch (1997) - Direct assessment of local accuracy and precision, and the paper of Goovaert (2001) - Geostatistical modelling of uncertainty in
soil science.
The meuse dataset from the gstat package is used.
